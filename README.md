# Handwritten Digit Recognition

Used the MNIST dataset for training and testing of various machine learning algorithms.

## Softmax Classifier

Coded softmax classifier using vanilla gradient descent in python.
Accuracy = 90.99

## Basic Neural Net from scratch

Coded a Neural Net with 3 hidden layers from scratch in python.
Implemented the forward pass and back-propogation algorithm using numpy.
Trained the model for 50 iterations.  
Accuracy = 95.39

## Using Tensorflow

The `README` inside the `keras/` folder gives the full details of the experiment.
The highlights are : best Accuracy = 99.31
